# svelte-sortable-nested-list-view #

a sortable view for nested lists which also supports dragging items into and out of a list

It is based on [svelte-drag-and-drop-actions](https://github.com/rozek/svelte-drag-and-drop-actions) and, consequently, on HTML5 native Drag-and-Drop.

(under active development, please stay tuned)
