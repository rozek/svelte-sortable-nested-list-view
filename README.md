# svelte-sortable-nested-list-view #

a sortable view for nested lists which also supports dragging items into and out of a list

It is based on [svelte-drag-and-drop-actions](https://github.com/rozek/svelte-drag-and-drop-actions) and, consequently, on HTML5 native Drag-and-Drop.

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/svelte-sortable-flat-list-view/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

**Mobile Developers**: since many mobile platforms lack support for native HTML5 drag-and-drop, you should consider importing [svelte-drag-drop-touch](https://github.com/rozek/svelte-drag-drop-touch) as a polyfill (a simple import of that package will suffice - there is no extra programming needed)

(under active development, please stay tuned)

> Just a small note: if you like this module and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.
